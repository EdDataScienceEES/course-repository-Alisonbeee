# Efficient Data Manipulation Challenge

# Objective:
# The Craigmillar Castle team would like a summary of the different species found 
  # within its grounds, but broken down in four quadrants (NE, NW, SE, SW). 
    # You can start from the trees.genus object created earlier.

# Aims:
# 1.Can you calculate the species richness (e.g. the number of different species) in each quadrant?
# 2.They would also like to know how abundant the genus Acer is (as a % of the total number of trees) in each quadrant.
# 3.Finally, they would like, for each quadrant separately, a bar plot showing counts of Acer trees 
    # in the different age classes, ordered so they read from Young (lumping together juvenile and semi-mature trees), Middle Aged, and Mature.
