# Week 6

#### Class Tutorials:

* [Intro to model design](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/model-design/)


#### Aims of this week are:
* To think about what my research questions are before I start statistical modelling.
* A way to do this is a pre-registration



#### Readings:

#### Trends
* Evidence suggests that insufficient transparency is a problem across much of ecology and evolution. Results and methods are often reported in insufficient detail or go entirely unreported. Further, these unreported results are often a biased subset, thus substantially hampering interpretation and meta-analysis.
* Journals and other institutions, such as funding agencies, influence researchersâ€™ decisions about disseminating results. There is a movement across empirical disciplines, including ecology and evolution, to shape institutional policies to better promote transparency.
* Institutions can promote transparency by requiring or encouraging more disclosure, as with the now-familiar data archiving, or by developing an incentive structure promoting disclosure, such as preregistration of studies and analysis plans.

[Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/)
* OSF is a free, open platform to support your research and enable collaboration.
* The place to share your research
