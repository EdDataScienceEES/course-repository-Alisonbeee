# Week-one

Note to self: Not sure fully how to use this yet but going to try keep all my notes in github.

Aim1: Hopefully will figure out the best way to save notes so I can access them in the best possible way. 

Aim2: Start readings today and make some notes


End of week 1: getting used to thinking a little for myself and troubleshooting simple issues

did have one confusion where my bar graph didn't work in the first tutorial but I just ran the code again and it magically fixed??!!

next aim: to start making graphs pretty
