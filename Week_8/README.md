[Bayesian statistics: What’s it all about?](http://andrewgelman.com/2016/12/13/bayesian-statistics-whats/)


* Bayesian statistics uses the mathematical rules of probability to combine data with prior information to yield inferences which (if the model being used is correct) are more precise than would be obtained by either source of information alone.

* The drawback of this Bayesian approach is that it can require a bit of a commitment to construction of a model that might be complicated, a

*  Bayesian inference requires difficult mathematical calculation

*  When Bayesian methods work best, it’s by providing a clear set of paths connecting data, mathematical/statistical models, and the substantive theory of the variation and comparison of interest.
