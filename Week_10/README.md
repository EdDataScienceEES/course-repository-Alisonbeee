#### Isla message about challenge 4
This issue will include any information that you need to prepare for Challenge 4.

Let us know if you are not able to make it to the Thursday session next week for the full three hours, so that we can find an alternative way to assess you.
Complete the Coding Club tutorial for the big data week and for the intro to Google Earth Engine.
Required skill sets for the challenge are:
* teamwork
* use of GitHub for collaborative work
* project management with a tight deadline
* data wrangling
* data visualisation
* simple statistical analyses and interpretation (linear models, hierarchical models not required)
* professional writing and communication
* a familiarity with the interface of the google Earth Engine and the forest cover change dataset (from the Coding Club tutorial)
* no knowledge of coding in JavaScript is required

You should not need to prepare beyond doing the Coding Club tutorial for this week and any revisions from previous weeks if you were not able to complete previous tutorials on the above topics.

You should find Challenge 4 to be fun and to summarise the skill sets you have built across the course!
