# Data Science 1st of Oct Zoom session


* 1: First go at cloning a repository to my computer 
* 2: Commit pull and push (how we interact with git hub with our computer) 
* 3: Everyone to work together in the course repository
* 4: Accept the course repository assignment (so they can see what I do on git hub and mark it… etc) These repository have deadlines on December 4th and sends over the repository
* 5: understand different types of files 
* 6: relative file path (concept) 
* 7: Think about coding etiquette (how I want to start every code)
* 8: understand collaborative coding 
* 9: prepare for version control next week

### * Tasks: download git onto computer 


## R related notes
What is R = it is a programming language 
What is R studio = A software we can use the language R, and a graphic interface
A .R file is a = Script
R mark down files (.rmd) = a readable version of your r code 
(You can make R notebooks) = ?? Need to lean this but it is similar to R markdown file (it is a way to read/send code)
Difference of note book and rmd file (the notebook is running it all the time and will show output at the end)(rmd is more like rStudio where you need to run each line)


## Caching
What is caching = storing files (a website on a second visit has saved cookies, photos, other files)  But in R it saves previously run code (so if there was a typo and you change your code and have to re run the whole code, instead of it taking ages it runs quicker due to it having saved previous code to cash). The cons are it takes up memory and if you have run a code for 3 months it can be useful to get rid of cash to check new code runs properly.

## Mark down 
Why would we not always use mark down = if its for the public do it in r markdown. But if I’m doing it for myself then do it in normal r script because I can annotate.

R markdown uses a range of languages (it is a markup language(it is more like a style you don’t write programs in it can use it to write notes))

## Text editor 
What is a text editor = it is an application on my Mac already

## More markdown
GitHub flavoured mark down = is a type of mark down that git hub recognises when creating websites 
(3 types normal mark down, r markdown, GitHub flavour markdown)
Git hub knows when it sees a flavour markdown to create a website


## Syntax 
is the grammar (commas, brackets)

## R data file = Where you store objects, 
When you close r studio it asks if you want to save your data as a r data file this occurs when you have not saved workspace 

What is git = a language 
What is GitHub = the environment and platform that uses git, a website, it is a “cloud” form of storage 


## Getting git on laptop
Downloading the git tab 
https://jennybc.github.io/2014-05-12-ubc/ubc-r/session03_git.html used this website but didn’t work 
I have downloaded honeydew and Xcode

### Now in week 3 I've solved this issue above and can use github in Rstudio much easier



# After this lecture (where I’m at)
Feeling highly confused about how to get git hub on my RStudio and then when it is there how it works? Feeling a bit stressed and need time to process things and work out step by step what I need to do and how I can be proactive in class chats without asking stupid things and constructive things????

Steps to help: Spend time at night looking through issues of the day maybe and see if they relate to me??


# Tutorials done
* Markdown: https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/rmarkdown/
* Coding Etiquette: https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/etiquette/)

# Markdown 
## Questions I want to find answers too
 - Which bits of code need to be displayed in the final .html file?
 - How can the formatting of the R markdown file be improved? (I think this is to do with the cheat sheet
 - Why use R markdown instead of an R studio file? (Maybe its because you dont need r to open it?)

Notes:
style="color:red">my text here</p> %>% means : we read the %>% as “and then”
