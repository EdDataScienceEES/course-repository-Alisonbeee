The benefits of git hub are

- Work becomes intergrated 
- Collaboration is much easier and a great tool
- A great website space to present code and working
- Great for courses such as “data science”
- Helps create competence in R quicker

Git hub issues help identify bugs with the whole group

You can push commits to git hub while you work which takes a snapshot of all files in the project

Every time you commit you must also write a commit message signaling what change was made and the diff will show the content??

You can designate snapshots as special with a tag .
