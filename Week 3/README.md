If both are doing work (when both push) the software picks it up and will flag up and then you can chose which version (you have to solve this before you can continue).


When there is a project opened from GitHub you can see what repository is open at the very top.

Repository files are bottom right 
- This holds all the folders and data

In top right box there’s a git tab
- When you save a script (update) in the git tab a M comes up and this shows you have modified the file.
- When I am happy I can select the file and commit it 
    - A box comes up and then I can write a message when I commit it (to say what I did)
    - Before I submit I should click pull (this checks that online repository is up to date) if it is not then someone else has changed it while I was working on it
    - Then when I push that makes what is online

Then go to online repository 
- On git it will highlight the change in green 
  The insight tab shows what everyone has done
