# **bold** Aim to connect github and rstudio 
### creating this as a R markdown because I want to learn how to do this a bit more

# got it to work !! yay !!
# will follow this up soon with my own notes when I understand how to use read me files or find another way to show my notes on github

# basic how to do it though is to save this file (in the student respository file)
# then select the file in the top right 
# then click commit 
# Then when I push that makes what is online
# Before I submit I should click pull (this checks that online repository is up to date) if it is not then someone else has changed it while I was working on it
# Then when I push that makes what is online

# ok did this and not its not working :(
